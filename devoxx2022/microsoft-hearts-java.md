# Microsoft ‚ù§ Java
A very short lunchtime talk by Martijn Verburg, formerly CEO of JClarity, which ran AdoptOpenJDK

## Microsoft has a ton of internal Java
* more than 2 million plus JVMs internally (not counting ones that are run by others on its Azure platform)
* Yammer is in Java
* LinkedIn, etc

## Microsoft has Satya Nadella
* a different attitude to interoperability and going where the customers are.
* (Apparently you can now talk to an Oracle database running on Oracle cloud from inside Azure!?)

## Bringing Java into Microsoft
* Martijn Verburg joined Microsoft a few years ago when JClarity was bought by Microsoft, in order to bring Java in
* when he joined he was given a lawyer and told him only objective for his first year was for Microsoft not to get sued
* they handed all Microsoft's Java patents over to the [JCP](https://www.jcp.org/en/home/index)
* they gave AdoptOpenJDK to Eclipse to become [Eclipse Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/)
* they've contributed to lots of Java work including getting stuff to work on the MacOS m1 architecture

## [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk)
* directly supported by his engineers
* they are working on issues to do with startup time etc
* their commitment is that they will be pushing successful things back upstream to OpenJDK
