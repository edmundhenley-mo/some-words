# Devoxx 2022
I went to Devoxx London last week, which was interesting, fun, and exhausting with possibilities. Highlights included:

* being asked to put a sticker on my id badge to say how much personal space I prefer (mine was red)
* getting a fist-bump from a Red Hat wizard because of my enthusiasm for Cucumber and BDD
* being given an impromptu medal by a chagrined Frenchman because I found a bug in the lab he was running.  

Also I have come to the zen realisation that the best freebies at conferences are the hidden ones that people dig out for you when you've had a really good conversation, 
and the worth you should accord to freebies is proportional to the excellence of the conversation you had.  
Who wouldn't rather have a good conversation than a free T-shirt? #geekmaturity

I've written a few blog entries about different interesting things, some on a specific talk, some broader:
* [Accessibility](accessibility.md) -- a short but very good keynote from someone at Microsoft
* [Climate-Commitment Terminology](climate-commitment-terminology.md) -- just a few notes on another interesting keynote
* [Microsoft ‚ù§ Java](microsoft-hearts-java.md) -- there were quite a few interesting talks on this. Microsoft was very present at the conference doing interesting stuff.
* [KNative](knative.md) -- there were several talks about this
* JIT vs AOT: GraalVM Native and CRaC -- this was the most interesting stuff for me
* Zen School of Github Actions -- a nice useful talk, inspired by [Ogmios's Zen School of Motoring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RidKpZEJj4E)
