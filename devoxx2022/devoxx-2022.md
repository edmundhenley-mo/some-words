# Devoxx 2022
I went to Devoxx London last week, which was interesting, fun, and exhausting with possibilities. 
Highlights included:
* everyone got to put a sticker on their id badge to say how much personal space they prefer (mine was red)
* I got a fist-bump from a Red Hat wizard because of my enthusiasm for Cucumber and BDD¹
* I was given an impromptu medal by a chagrined Frenchman because I found a bug in the lab he was running.  

Also I have come to the zen realisation that the best freebies at conferences 
are the hidden ones that people dig out for you when you've had a really good conversation, 
and the worth you should accord to freebies is proportional to the excellence of the conversation you had. 
Who wouldn't rather have a good conversation than a free T-shirt? _#geekmaturity_

I've written a few blog entries about different interesting things, some on a specific talk, 
some broader things written from my own perspective:
* [Accessibility](accessibility.md) -- summary of a short but very good keynote from someone at Microsoft
* [Climate-Commitment Terminology](climate-commitment-terminology.md) -- just a few notes on another short keynote by an interesting Microsoft person
* [Zen School of GitHub Actions](zen-github-actions.md) -- a nice useful talk, inspired by [Ogmios's Zen School of Motoring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RidKpZEJj4E)
* [Microsoft ❤ Java](microsoft-hearts-java.md) -- Microsoft was very present at the conference doing interesting stuff
* [Knative from the perspective of a Step-Function user](knative.md) -- there were several talks about Knative -- my interest in it is because of what we do in AWS Step Functions
* JIT vs AOT compilation: GraalVM Native and CRaC -- this was the most interesting stuff for me

¹ OK so the fistbump did not accord with the red personal-space sticker, 
but I told him my story about the time a Product Owner asked about specific NSWWS dissemination business rules 
some years after the system was written
and I was able to answer her question by showing her the Cucumber specs 
instead of using possibly-decayed documentation,
and anyone who works with me knows that this is a _very exciting story_.
